<p id="id00009">Welcome to the schoolroom of 1900. The moral tone is plain. "She is kind
to the old blind man."</p>

<p id="id00010">The exercises are still suitable, and perhaps more helpful than some
contemporary alternatives. Much is left to the teacher. Explanations given
in the text are enough to get started teaching a child to read and write.
Counting in Roman numerals is included as a bonus in the form of lesson
numbers.</p>

<p id="id00023" style="margin-top: 2em">Preface</p>

<p id="id00024">The flattering success of McGuffey's Revised Readers, and the inquiry for
more primary reading matter to be used in the first year of school work,
have induced the Publishers to prepare a REVISED PRIMER, which may be used
to precede the First Reader of any well arranged series.</p>

<p id="id00025">The method pursued is the same as that in McGuffey's Revised Readers, and
the greatest possible care has been taken to insure a gradation suited to
the youngest children. Only about six new words are to be mastered in each
lesson. These new words and the new elementary sounds are always to be
found in the vocabulary of the lesson in which they are first used.</p>

<p id="id00026">The plan of the book enables the teacher to pursue the Phonic Method, the<br/>

Word Method, the Alphabet Method, or any combination of these methods.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00027">Illustrations of the best character have been freely supplied, and the
skilled teacher will be able to use them to great advantage.</p>

<p id="id00028">The script exercises throughout the book and the slate exercises at the
close, have been specially written and carefully engraved for this Primer;
they may be used to teach the reading of script, and as exercises in
learning to write.</p>

<p id="id00029">In the full confidence that the public will appreciate a cheap and
attractive Primer of this character, the Publishers have spared no expense
to make this book equal, in type, paper, and illustrations, to any that
have been issued from their Press.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

<h4 id="id00510" style="margin-top: 2em">Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h4>

<p id="id00511">Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p id="id00512">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<h4 id="id00517" style="margin-top: 2em">Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h4>

<p id="id00518">Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p id="id00519">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org</p>

<p id="id00520">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p id="id00521">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p id="id00522">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate</p>

<h4 id="id00523" style="margin-top: 2em">Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h4>

<p id="id00524">Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p id="id00525" style="margin-top: 2em">Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p id="id00526" style="margin-top: 2em">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:</p>

<p id="id00527">     http://www.gutenberg.net<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00528">This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
